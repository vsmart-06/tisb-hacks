# TISB Hacks

Team name: Operation ByteSmash

### The idea

- A car sharing platform where commuters allow other people to ride along with them if their destination is along the same path

- Using a ride requires you to use some credits from your account

- Giving a ride to someone else will add credits to your account

- This app gives users an opportunity to do their part in helping the environment by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere
